			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>According to the AKC Standard, the Siberian Husky "does not display the possessive qualities of the guard dog,
			but is he overly suspicious of strangers or aggressive with other dogs." Their exotic, wolf-like appearance makes
			Huskies appealing to many people, and their even temperament, love of other dogs and indifference to strangers makes them 
			ideal family dogs. Huskies have a zest for life that is unmatched by few breeds.</p>
			<br>Every time a Husky is outside, it's as if it's his first time and well into adulthood Huskies play with the vigor of a puppy.
			They may seem like a good family dog for first time dog owners, but Huskies can often be “too much dog” for a novice.
			<br>They require extensive training and exercise in order maintain good behavior and only those with the time and energy to fully
			commit to a Husky should take on this breed. But Husky owners agree, you get out of a Siberian Husky what you put into him,
			and these reliable dogs are worth the effort.
			<h4>Activity Requirements</h4>
			<p>Siberian Huskies need a lot of vigorous activity in order to maintain health and happiness. They were developed as sled dogs, 
			which means they have energy and endurance to spare, so adopting a Husky means adopting an active lifestyle. This breed enjoys long walks,
			hikes, jogs and bike rides. In the yard they can play fetch for hours, and some even like to play frisbee.</p>
			<br>Huskies will feel as though they died and went to heaven when at the dog park with other dogs to run, romp and wrestle with.
			<br>Their medium size makes Siberian Huskies appealing to apartment dwellers, but this may not be the best living situation for a Husky.
			<br>They are rowdy and rambunctious well into adulthood and need plenty of room to move about.
			<h5>Trainability</h5>
			<p>Husky owners claim their dogs have the ability to perform at the top of their obedience classes, but when they come home they 
			ignore everything they learned, only to turn it back on again when they return to the next class.</p>
			<br> This breed is notoriously difficult to train and are generally not well suited for first time owners.
			<br>Huskies require firm leadership and 100% consistency when it comes to boundaries and rule enforcement.
			<br> Their expressive eyes can be used to manipulate the softies of the house, so all family members must also be “trained” to be 
			consistent with rules and leadership.
